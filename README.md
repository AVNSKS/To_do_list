# 📝 To-Do List Web App

A simple, elegant, and interactive To-Do List built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app allows users to add tasks, remove individual tasks, and bulk-delete selected tasks with a visual highlight for easy interaction.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add new tasks using the input box
- ❌ Delete individual tasks using a remove button (❌)
- 🔵 Select multiple tasks by clicking on them (highlighted with a blue border)
- 🗑️ Delete all selected tasks using the "DEL" button
- 🧼 Clean UI with animated buttons and shadow effects

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of the app
- **CSS3** – Styling with gradients, shadows, and transitions
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – Logic for adding, selecting, and deleting tasks


## 🧠 How It Works

1. Type a task in the input box and click **ADD**.
2. The task will appear below with a ❌ remove icon on the right.
3. Click a task to **toggle selection** (highlight with a blue border).
4. Click the **DEL** button to remove all selected tasks at once.
5. Use the ❌ icon to delete a specific task immediately.
